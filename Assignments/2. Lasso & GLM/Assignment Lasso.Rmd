# 1. Lasso for the Boston Housing data

For this assignment, we will again be working with the Boston Housing dataset from https://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston

```{r}
Y <- scale(Boston$medv, center=TRUE, scale=FALSE) # Center but no rescaling on the response
X <- scale(as.matrix(Boston[,1:13]), center = TRUE, scale = TRUE) # Center and rescaling,
n <- dim(X)[1]
p <- dim(X)[2]
```
